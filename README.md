# Object Counting and Detection Using Image Processing in MATLAB

## Overview

This project demonstrates an object detection and counting system using MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox. It processes a given image, removes noise, segments the objects, and counts them, finally displaying the original image with bounding boxes and labels around each detected object.

## Features

- Automatic conversion of RGB to grayscale
- Noise removal using median filtering
- Image binarization using Otsu's thresholding
- Removal of small unwanted regions
- Hole filling in objects
- Object detection using connected component labeling
- Visualization of results with bounding boxes and labels

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB (R2018 or later recommended)
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Place the project script and input image in the same directory.
3. Rename your input image (if necessary) to match the file used in the code or update the filename in the script.
4. Run the script.
